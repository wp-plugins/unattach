== Description ==

Unattach is a very simple plugin which allows detaching images and other media from WordPress posts, pages and other content types.

The only way to detach a media item from a post in WordPress is to delete either the post or the media item. This plugin solves that by adding an 'Unattach' link below each media file in the Media Library admin view.
